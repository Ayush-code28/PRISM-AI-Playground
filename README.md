# Multi-LLM-Chat-Playground

Welcome to the **Multi-LLM Chat Playground!** 🎉 This interactive app lets you compare responses from multiple **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in real-time using **LiteLLM** — a lightweight, unified API for interacting with different LLM providers.

✨ Supported Models
* **GPT-4o**
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
* **Cohere Command R Plus**

Whether you’re experimenting with **creative prompts** or exploring the models' different styles, this app provides a fun, easy way to see how each model handles the same input.


## Why Use This? 🤔
* **Instantly compare** responses from GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Cohere Command R Plus.
  
* **Explore** how different prompts shape model responses.
  
* **Test different types of prompts**, from technical to creative.
  
* **Gain insights** into how models interpret the same input differently.
